Why IronPython?
---------------
Python is an excellent
addition to the .NET Framework, providing Python developers with the power
of the .NET framework. Existing .NET developers can also use IronPython
s a fast and expressive scripting language for embedding, testing, or
writing a new application from scratch.

The CLR is a great platform for creating
programming languages, and the DLR makes it all the more better for
dynamic languages. Also, the .NET framework (base class library,
presentation foundation, Silverlight, etc) give an amazing amount of
functionality and power to developers.
