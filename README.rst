===============================
IronPython.net and IronRuby.net
===============================

Summary
-------
IronRuby.net and IronPython.net share the same infrastructure; basically the
same CSS, HTML templates, images, HTML generation and deployment scripts.
The only things different are the content, which are stored in the ``python``
and ``ruby`` directories.
